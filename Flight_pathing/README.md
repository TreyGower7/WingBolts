as of right now edit main in `map_vis.py` for whatever file name


### Note:
I don't see any need for having to create a realtime flight path visualization for the mission. 
So my plan as of rn is to just feed in the flight log at the end of the flight for visualization

### To do:
We will need to viz the target locations (i think they said with a picture of the target would be nice) 
We probably need some script that attaches gps coords to camera feed using time-- will be hard bc the time parameter in the flight logs is very weird... take a look at the csv to understand
